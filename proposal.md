# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Association for Information Systems Discord Bot

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A discord bot to support my student organizations server. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The bot will allow students to execute commands to get information on our student organization. The first feature I would like to create is a command that you can enter that display upcoming events for our organization. Depending on how much time I have, I will implement other features including: requesting office hours, registering for an event, and viewing your attendance history.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
NA

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

NA

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

This project will allow me to add more or less features depending on how much time I have. However, if I am able to get a functional bot on discord that does something, I will be happy.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I can get my bot on discord and running with 2+ features listed above.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I can get my bot on discord and running with all features listed above.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to learn how to deploy my code onto a discord server. Additionally, I need to research python libraries that I could use for this project. Beyond that, I will need to expand my knowledge of Python in general.
